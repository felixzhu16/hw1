                <p>My name is Felix, I'm in the last quarter of my MS in CS and have some experience using Javascript and React in my internship this past summer.</p>
                <p>I've also dabbled a little in HTML with other classes, but wouldn't say I'm that familiar with it yet.</p>

                <h3>Goals for the class?</h3>
                <p> I'd like to be more familiar with front end development with web applications and am looking forward to that in this class.</p>

                <h3>Discord or group chat?</h3>        
                <p>Personally I've found class Discord servers to be the most productive since we can have multiple channels for questions, announcements and communication between classmates.</p>
